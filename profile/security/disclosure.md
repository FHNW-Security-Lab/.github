# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

We appreciate your help in making our projects more secure! If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our repositories:

1. Go to the affected repository
2. Click on "Issues"
3. Create a new issue
4. Use the title prefix `[SECURITY]` 
5. Describe the vulnerability and how to reproduce it

Please include:
- Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected versions/components
- Potential impact
- Suggestions for fixes (if any)

We will respond to security issues as quickly as possible and keep you updated on the progress.

## Scope

This policy applies to all public repositories under the FHNW Security Lab organization.

## Recognition

We appreciate the security research community's efforts and will credit researchers who report valid vulnerabilities (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).
